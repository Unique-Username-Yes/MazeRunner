# MazeRunner
Unity3D game implementation of A* path finding algorithm. Main purpose of this project is to test and understand how A* algorithm
find path to the destination avoiding obstacles like walls

# How this project helped me
Implementing A* helped me to understand how this path finding algorithm devides area into grid space and searches for best posible
path towards specified destination. After implementing basic version, I decided to restrict movement of player block, so that
it would not be possible to move diagonally.
